Playpal is an Android based mobile application that brings together caring and responsible dog owners. Dogs greatly benefit 
from socializing with each other because this helps them with their behavior, health, and happiness. The goal of this app is 
to make it easier for users to locate and communicate with other users in order to set playdates for their respective dogs.
Users can approve or skip different profiles to find dogs they believe their own dogs would socialize well with.
