The Play-pal app is an app that brings together caring and responsible dog owners. Dogs need to socialize 
with other dogs because this helps them with their behavior, health, and happiness. The goal of this app is to make
it easier for dog owners to have their dogs socialize with other dogs. Owners can look at different dog profiles to 
find dogs they want their dogs to socialize with.
